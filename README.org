#+TITLE: helm-buffer-aliases

Aliasing for buffers in helm-buffers-list. I keep a bunch of ~index.org~ files in
various directories and the default ~helm-source~ doesn't help that much in
navigation.

So the plan is to allow a wrapping layer over the buffer source and let me,
e.g., pick something from the file content (like title) as the identifier.
